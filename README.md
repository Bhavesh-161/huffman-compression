# Huffman Compression

A minimal huffman compression program using C++ language.

# Theory
Huffman compression is based on huffman coding technique. The huffman coding creates an optimal binary tree that is constructed based on frequency of an item/character in a file.

Let's take an example of a file or string containing data like "AAABBCAAADDFFAAAADCCCDAADDDAAACGAAACACA"
